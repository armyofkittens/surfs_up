# Surf's Up
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to ensure that our business has a steady cash flow year-round for Avy, our investor. Our previous analysis pulled temperature data over the course of one year, however Avy wanted data year-over-year for the first month of summer and the first month of winter. Comparing the two should determine the seasonality of the business. 

## Results
* The average temperature only varies by 4 degrees between summer and winter.
* Temperatures do reach ca minimum of 56 degrees in December, however that is a large deviation from the average, which means overall the weather is still warm.
* Temperature variation is not dramatic overall between summer and winter. 

## Summary
After analyzing both the precipitation and temperature, it is evident that neither fluctuate dramatically. The average temperatue is in the low 70's between both June and December, and both carry a similar standard deviation. In conclusion, the weather should not impact Surf and Shake's revenue stream.
