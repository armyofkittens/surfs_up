# Surf's Up
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to ensure that our business has a steady cash flow year-round for Avy, our investor. Our previous analysis pulled temperature data over the course of one year, however Avy wanted data year-over-year for the first month of summer and the first month of winter. Comparing the two should determine the seasonality of the business. 

## Results
* The average temperature only varies by 4 degrees between summer and winter.
* Temperatures do reach ca minimum of 56 degrees in December, however that is a large deviation from the average, which means overall the weather is still warm.
* Temperature variation and precipitation is not dramatic overall between summer and winter.
